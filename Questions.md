Absolutely! Here's how a senior firmware engineer with 10 years of experience might answer those interview questions—this time referencing insights from freely available articles and touching on relevant APIs, especially in the context of systems like FreeRTOS and POSIX:

### **1. What is a Mutex?**

A **mutex** (mutual exclusion) is a synchronization primitive used to protect shared resources. It ensures that only one thread or task can access a critical section at a time. According to [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/operating-systems/mutex-vs-semaphore/), mutexes enforce *strict ownership*—only the task that locks it can unlock it. This is crucial in embedded systems where shared peripherals like SPI or I²C buses are accessed by multiple tasks.

**API Example (FreeRTOS):**
```c
SemaphoreHandle_t xMutex = xSemaphoreCreateMutex();
xSemaphoreTake(xMutex, portMAX_DELAY);
// critical section
xSemaphoreGive(xMutex);
```

### **2. What is the Concept of Ownership?**

Ownership refers to the idea that the task which acquires a mutex is the only one allowed to release it. This prevents accidental unlocks and enforces discipline in resource management. As [FreeRTOS documentation](https://en.freertos.org/Documentation/02-Kernel/04-API-references/10-Semaphore-and-Mutexes/06-xSemaphoreCreateMutex) explains, this is what differentiates a mutex from a binary semaphore.

### **3. What is a Race Condition?**

A **race condition** occurs when multiple threads access shared data concurrently, and the final outcome depends on the timing of their execution. This can lead to unpredictable behavior. A great example from [CodeProject](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/5388900/What-is-a-Race-Condition-Causes-Examples-and-Solut) illustrates a bank account scenario where simultaneous deposits and withdrawals without synchronization lead to incorrect balances.

**Prevention:** Use mutexes or atomic operations to serialize access.

### **4. What is a Semaphore?**

A **semaphore** is a signaling mechanism. It can be binary (0 or 1) or counting (0 to N). Unlike mutexes, semaphores don’t enforce ownership. They’re ideal for signaling between tasks or managing a pool of resources, like buffer slots or UART channels.

**API Example (FreeRTOS):**
```c
SemaphoreHandle_t xSemaphore = xSemaphoreCreateCounting(5, 5);
xSemaphoreTake(xSemaphore, portMAX_DELAY); // acquire resource
xSemaphoreGive(xSemaphore); // release resource
```

### **5. Difference Between Mutex and Semaphore**

| Feature         | Mutex                                      | Semaphore                                   |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Ownership       | Enforced (only owner can release)           | Not enforced                                |
| Use Case        | Mutual exclusion                            | Signaling or resource counting              |
| API (FreeRTOS)  | `xSemaphoreCreateMutex()`                   | `xSemaphoreCreateBinary()` / `Counting()`   |
| Priority Inversion Handling | Yes (via priority inheritance) | No                                          |

As [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/operating-systems/mutex-vs-semaphore/) and [Guru99](https://www.guru99.com/mutex-vs-semaphore.html) explain, mutexes are best for exclusive access, while semaphores are more flexible for signaling and resource pools.

If you'd like, I can walk you through a real-world firmware scenario using these APIs—maybe something like task synchronization in a sensor fusion system or managing DMA buffers. Want to dive into that?
